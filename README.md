## Financial Calculator
The financial calculator program aims to assist in calculating returns on investment under specified timeframe and interest rate. Alternatively, the program can calculate monthly repayment of the house loan (under chosen timeframe and interest rate as well).
This was the first Capstone Project I accomplished during Data Science Bootcamp training which tested my knowledge in Python at great length.
